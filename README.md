# ReactReduxBoilerPlateWCreateReactApp
React Redux boilerplate made with create-react-app

### Use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) for dependency management instead of npm!

```
yarn
```
Installs the dependencies

```
yarn start
```

Starts the development server.

```
yarn build
```
Bundles the app into static files for production.

```
yarn test
```

Starts the test runner.

```
yarn eject
```
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

I suggest that you begin by typing:

```
git clone git@github.com:florestankorp/ReactReduxBoilerPlateWCreateReactApp.git
cd ReactReduxBoilerPlateWCreateReactApp
yarn start
```
